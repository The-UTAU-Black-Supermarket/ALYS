* What is ALYS?
ALYS is a virtual French singer developed by VoxWave from 2014
to 2020. It has two main editions: its UTAU prototype, developed
between 2014 and 2015, and its Alter/Ego edition developed between
2015 and 2020.

* Vocal Libraries
ALYS got several libraries since the project started:
- French Libraries
  - ALYS DB 001 FRA :: The first French vocal library made for ALYS.
    This library was recorded at the same time as /ALYS DB 001 JP/ but
    was later scrapped due to its low quality.
    - License :: GPL-3.0
    - Path :: [[file:./UTAU/ALYS_DB_001_FRA]]
  - ALYS DB 002 FRA :: The second French library made for ALYS. It was
    made for UTAU and became her first vocal library ever heard. It is
    available under the GPL-3.0 license.
    - License :: GPL-3.0
    - Path :: [[file:./UTAU/ALYS_DB_002_FRA]]
  - ALYS DB 003 FRA :: Codename /ALYS4AE FR/. This is the first publicly
    released French vocal library published along /ALYS4AE JP/. Its
    installer as well as a license key are available under the
    [[file:./AlterEgo/]] directory.

    A modified version of its source files are available under the
    GPL-3.0 under the directory . This directory does not contain
    anything related to Alter/Ego. They can be used to create a new
    UTAU vocal library. Pull requests are more than welcomed for
    ~oto.ini~ files for this library.

* Installing ALYS4AE
/ALYS4AE/ refers to the bundle of /ALYS4AE FR/ and /ALYS4AE JP/. They can be
installed on Windows with their ~.exe~ installer or on macOS with their
~.pkg~ installer found in [[file:./AlterEgo/]] directory. Once installed,
open AlterEgo either as a standalone or as an instrument in your DAW
(Digital Audio Workstation) of choice and drag and drop the [[file:./AlterEgo/VoxWave.png][licence
image]] on the AlterEgo interface. Installing ALYS4AE requires a
pre-existing installation of Alter/Ego itself. You can get it from
